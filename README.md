# 1518 dancing plague in Strasbourg

Back in 1518 a dancing plague occured in Strasbourg, [see Wikipedia for more info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancing_plague_of_1518). It is an example of an epidemic. The goal of this repo is to simulate the epidemic usign agent based simulation and see how decisions about the capacity of icu beds and the lockdown strictness can affect the outcome of the epidemic both in terms of number of people dead and in terms of money spent. 

## NetLogo

The simulation is done using [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/). It has a specific language and you can use the IDE to developp the simulation. You'll also have an interface allowing you to play with the parameters you'll define and to see the evolution of the simulation. 

## R 

The NetLogo simulation is ran using R to be able to run multiple scenarios, changing some parameters, and to have a list of the outcomes.
